L-01:setRebalanceUpThreshold() need to add a restriction not less than REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD

In `preRebalanceCheck()` it will determine if `isRebalanceUp` based on REBALANCE_UP_THRESHOLD/ and REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD
So theoretically, the values of REBALANCE_UP_THRESHOLD/ and REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD cannot overlap
Avoid the overlapping part of `rebalanceDown` from being executed


```solidity
    function setRebalanceUpThreshold(
        uint256 newRebalanceUpThreshold
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        emit SetRebalanceUpThreshold(
            REBALANCE_UP_THRESHOLD,
            newRebalanceUpThreshold
        );
+       require(newRebalanceUpThreshold>REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD,"bad");

        REBALANCE_UP_THRESHOLD = newRebalanceUpThreshold;
    }
```

L-02: L-02:setRebalanceDownThreshold() needs to add a restriction that the value set cannot be greater than REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD

Similar to the description of L-01, `setRebalanceDownThreshold()' should be restricted to be no greater than `REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD`.

```solidity
    function setRebalanceDownThreshold(
        uint256 newRebalanceDownThreshold
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        emit SetRebalanceDownThreshold(
            REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD,
            newRebalanceDownThreshold
        );
+       require(newRebalanceDownThreshold < REBALANCE_UP_THRESHOLD);
        REBALANCE_DOWN_THRESHOLD = newRebalanceDownThreshold;
    }
```

L-03:getReward() It is recommended to add balance>0 before executing transfer

`getReward()` will do a transfer on `rewaredsToken`
Since the rewards are from `convex`, we can't be sure what kind of token it is.
we can't be sure what kind of token it is, currently, some tokens will fail if the transfer amount=0
This will result in other tokens not being transferred out as well

Suggest adding non-zero judgment

```solidity
   function getReward(bool claimExtras) external {
        IBaseRewardPool(cvxPoolInfo.rewards).getReward(
            address(this),
            claimExtras
        );
        if (rewardsRecipient != address(0)) {
            for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
                uint256 balance = IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).balanceOf(
                    address(this)
                );
+               if (balance >0){
                  IERC20(rewardTokens[i]).safeTransfer(rewardsRecipient, balance);
+               }                
            }
        }
    }
```    


L-04:setAMO() needs to be added to determine if the old and new are not the same

If the old is the same as the new, then revert, to avoid passing in the old as the new and thinking it is set as the new

```solidity
    function setAMO(address newAMO) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        /// @dev if the new AMO is address(0), revert
        if (newAMO == address(0)) {
            revert AddressZeroProvided();
        }

+      require(newMAO !=curveAMO,"same");
...
```


L-05:withdrawAllAndUnwrap() suggests adding operator!=address(0)
`operator` is modifiable, and there is no restriction == address(0)
So it is recommended to add judgment to avoid turning to address(0)

```solidity
    function withdrawAllAndUnwrap(
        bool claim,
        bool sendToOperator
    ) external onlyOwner {
        IBaseRewardPool(cvxPoolInfo.rewards).withdrawAllAndUnwrap(claim);
        if (sendToOperator) {
            uint256 totalBalance = clpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+           require(operator!=address(0));
            clpToken.safeTransfer(operator, totalBalance);
        }
    }
```

L-06:removeLiquidityOnlyStETH() The minAmounts variable is not used and is recommended to be deleted

```solidity
    function removeLiquidityOnlyStETH(
        uint256 lpAmount,
        uint256 minStETHOut
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {

-       uint256[2] memory minAmounts;

-       minAmounts[stETHIndex] = minStETHOut;


```

L-07:rebalanceUp()/rebalanceDown() suggest restricting `msg.sender==defender`

The current permission restriction for `rebalanceUp()/rebalanceDown()` is via `onlyRole(REBALANCE_DEFENDER_ROLE)`
But this permission administrator can give authorization to anyone via `grantRole()`, and not generate `emit DefenderUpdated` event
So it is recommended to determine whether `msg.sender==defender` is more rigorous

L-08:stopDrip() It is recommended to remove the `dripEnabled` restrict

`stopDrip()` will execute `drip`->`_accrueDrip()` first
It is possible that `_accrueDrip()` will set `dripEnabled` to true
But `stopDrip()` will determine that `dripEnabled` can't be true, so it can't be set.

feel that judging `dripEnabled` doesn't make much sense and may cause failure, so I suggest removing it.

```solidity
    function stopDrip() external onlyOwner drip {

...        
-     if (!dripEnabled) revert DripAlreadyStopped();//maybe `drip` let it become false in this transcation

```
